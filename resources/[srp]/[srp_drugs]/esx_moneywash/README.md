# esx_moneywash
Simple moneywash for ESX Fivem

Original script from https://github.com/ESX-PUBLIC/esx_blanchisseur

Removed opening hours, fixed menu not closing and much more.
Right now location is Counterfeit cash factory, so i think you need Bob74 ipl loader (https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl) and teleport for that.

-Activate the blip on the map, if you want to disable it in false
-You can set if user has menu option or not.# esx_moneywash
